# Beginnings

November 2019

We started in a community church with only a handful of volunteers. Due to the expensive process of renting, it was unsure if we could continue for another year.

Covid hit and we switched to zoom. Now, three years later, we have taught over 500 students, have 20+ volunteers, opened an East Coast chapter, and have students placing state-wide and nationally for Math Kangaroo.
